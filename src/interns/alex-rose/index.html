<h1>
    Hi! My name is Alex Rose and I would love to be hired by Lob.
</h1>
<h2>First, the boring stuff:</h2>
<p>I’m a Junior majoring in Computer Science but I will likely be graduating in 2021. Most of my work outside of class is as a Mulcahy Fellow, where I lead a team on the History of Computing. I’m the Vice President of Don’t Panic, the Computer Science at Loyola. </p>
<p>Besides all of that, I love running, tracking different art I find in Chicago, and history.</p>

<p>This is my favorite piece of Art in Chicago (DELIGHT, by Key Detail) </p>
<h2>Now, to the fun stuff:</h2>
<p>In my opinion, software engineering can be generalized to into 4 different steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>“I want to build something”</li>
    <li>“I need to solve these problems to build the thing”</li>
    <li>"I have solved the problems but now want to improve the thing"</li>
    <li>“I need to solve these problems to improve the thing”</li>
</ol>
<p>This cycle goes on and on until you either ditch the project or start something new. Luckily, I love building things and solving problems.</p>
<p>
    There’s a misconception about coding, that it’s all about math and algorithms. To an extent, this is true, but it misses the best thing about coding, which is the creativity of it at all. Each problem can be solved in very different ways and finding your own solution (at least to more complex problems) usually requires some creativity. This is a long way of saying that I want to be a software engineer because I love creating things.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, I would love to work with on front-end software since much of my experience is with Frontend frameworks like React.JS and more recently Vue. I also have experience with Python and Java, but I think I’m better at front-end development (mostly because I enjoy it more).
</p>

</p>
<p>As an intern, I would prefer to learn by doing. If I can learn more about different aspects of software engineering, whether that be web development or something totally new to me. If I'm able to build things (no matter how small), that would be ideal. This is probably mutually beneficial to me as well as the company.</p>
